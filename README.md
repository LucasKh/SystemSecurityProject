# SystemSecurityProject
This project implements security features and represents a safe login for the users. The data of the users are saved in a table in SQL database in the form of rows and columns. 
The project includes: 
Ceaser Cipher: Encryption/Decryption
Brute Force technique: is a type of attack that the hacker uses to break a certain CEASER cypher hoping to guess the correct combination. It tries all the all the alphabetical keys K from 1 to 26 -	 the key space in ceaser cipher is very limited [1 to 25] and could be discovered by a brute force attempt
Rail-Fence: Encryption/Decryption - The user will enter the password alongside with message and the cryptographic application will encrypt the message. Same process is done for decryption. 
# Features 
Two factor Authentication(2fa): The user will register using his email and password. A confirmation email will be sent accordingly and he will verify the registration.
RGB pattern: The app will prompt the user to choose 10 colors the way he wants so this adds another layer of security. 
Picture Order: The app contains a set of pictures, the app prompts the user to choose a pattern based on his choice adding a third layer of security. 
This being said, the app includes 3 layers of security to ensure that the user's account is safe. 
# SQLDatabase
The app allows the user to create an account, delete an account, and saves all the logs of the algorithms in the form of tables.
